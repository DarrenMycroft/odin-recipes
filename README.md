The Odin Project: Recipes  

This project aims to put to practical use the knowledge I have
learned going through The Odin Project: Foundations Course and build 
upon the skills that I have already learned through freeCodeCamp:
Responsive Wed Design Certification. I will be strictly following the 
instructions laid out by TOP so I doubt there will be much oppertunity
to flex (pun intented) my CSS skills to make a truely responsive project. 

In this project I will build a basic recipe website using HTML written in
VSCode and using DVCS Git and Github to store my code as I progress. What
I am expecting to gain is to create good coding habits for myself such as
atomic commits, commit often, and creating good commit messages, as well 
as whatever else TOP throws my way as I go through the challenge. 

So here goes, HAPPY CODING!!
